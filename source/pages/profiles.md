## Profiles

The following Profiles have been identified for use with this implementation guide. Where possible, US Core have been used as the basis for this implementation guide. The use of QI-Core profiles was considered but ultimately, those profiles contained additional constraints which were not needed for the use cases of this document.

|Resource Type|Profile Name|Link to R4 Profile|
|---|---|---|
|Patient|FHIR Patient Profile|[FHIR Patient (R4)]|
|Immunization|US Core Immunization Profile|[US Core Immunization (R4)]|
|ImmunizationEvaluation|FHIR ImmunizationEvaluation Profile|[FHIR ImmunizationEvaluation (R4)]|
|ImmunizationRecommendation|FHIR ImmunizationRecommendation Profile|[FHIR ImmunizationRecommendation (R4)]|
