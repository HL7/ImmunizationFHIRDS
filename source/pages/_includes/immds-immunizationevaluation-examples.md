<h3>Must Support</h3>

<p>
For CDS engines, the engine must be capable of generating the Must Support elements even though the CDS process may not always result in a value. For example, there may not always be a doseStatusReason and invalid doses may not have a dose number. For the system requesting the forecast, that system must be capable of receiving the Must Support elements from the engine and when appropriate presenting them back to a user (either through a IU or through an HL7 message, etc).
